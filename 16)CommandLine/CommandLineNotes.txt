					HYPER TERMINAL(git,git bash,command line,terminal)
We need to cinfigure hyper to use git bash.
We use shells(GUI,Command Line) to interact with the kernal of the os.
Bash shell is a Command Line Interpreter(CLI) for the UNIX system.

pwd                       //printing working directory
rm *                      //removes all files in current folder
//always check with directory you are in beforw doing any deleting commands.
$ rm -r foldername  (-r is a flag)

rm -rf .git //deletes the git repository leaving remaining files unthouched

mv -f /path/subfolder/{.,}* /path/  //move all folders including hidden ones from one location to another
